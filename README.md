# TylersFirstPortfolioProject
I will showcase what skills in the Python and SQL/Tableu programs/software that I have as I begin my first SQL/Data project.

I am a beginner in the world of Python/SQL/Data/Coding. I am excited to be on this journey in my life as I am very fortunate to be alive and able to put forth this effort and time. I am to utilize all my resources to secure a job in Data or in the IT world as a whole.
